Please use one of the branches.


**4.20 OSS Enhanced - No Rama Save:**  This requires a patched version of the engine, and the OSS enhanced UETopia plugin.  This contains all of the UETOPIA functionality.  This branch has The references to Rama Save commented out.

**4.19 OSS Enhanced - Complete:**  This requires a patched version of the engine, and the OSS enhanced UETopia plugin.  This contains all of the proper functionality.  Use this for serious projects.



**4.19 Marketplace:**  This runs on the stock 4.19.x engine.  It is missing some important OSS functionality, and has hacky workarounds in place to provide the required functionality.  Chat channel list changed, and Friends list chaged delegates are set up to be polling instead.  Matchmaker and Tournaments are non-functional.  You can use this for testing and evaluation, but for serious projects, you should use the enhanced version instead.
